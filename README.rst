Spatio-temporal data handling and visualization in GRASS GIS
============================================================

Spatio-temporal data handling and visualization in GRASS GIS workshop
was created for FOSS4G 2014 conference in Portland, Oregon.

Abstract for FOSS4G 2014
------------------------

Drowning in too many maps? Have some fun exploring fascinating
geometries of changing landscapes in Space Time Cube and creating 2D
and 3D animations from time series of geospatial data. Learn about the
new capabilities for spatio-temporal data handling in GRASS GIS 7
(http://grass.osgeo.org/grass7/) and explore various techniques for
dynamic visualizations.

First, we will introduce you to GRASS GIS 7, including its
spatio-temporal capabilities and you will learn how to manage and
analyze geospatial data time series. Then, we will explore new tools
for visualization of spatio-temporal data. You will create both 2D and
3D dynamic visualizations directly in GRASS GIS 7. Additionally, we
will explain the Space Time Cube concept using various applications
based on raster and vector data time series. You will learn to manage
and visualize data in space time cubes (voxel models). No prior
knowledge of GRASS GIS is necessary, we will cover the basics needed
for the workshop. All relevant material including an overview of the
tools and hands-on practical instructions along with the sample data
sets will be available on-line. And, by the way, GRASS GIS is a free
and open source geographic information system (GIS) used for geospatial
data management, analysis, modeling, image processing, and
visualization which runs on Linux, MS Windows, Mac OS X and other
systems.
